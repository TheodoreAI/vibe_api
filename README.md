- {"title":"first_sent", "input_text": "Midway on our life's journey, I found myself In dark woods the right road lost. To tell About those woods is hard--so tangled and rough And savage that thinking of it now, I feel The old fear stirring: death is hardly more bitter. And yet, to treat the good I found there as well I'll tell what I saw, though how I came to enter I cannot well say, being so full of sleep Whatever moment it was I began to blunder Off the true path. But when I came to stop Below a hill that marked one end of the valley That had pierced my heart with terror, I looked up Toward the crest and saw its shoulders already Mantled in rays of that bright planet that shows The road to everyone, whatever our journey."}
